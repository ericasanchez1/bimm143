## What is in the PDB database? 

The main repository of biomolecular structure info is in the PDB <www.rcsb.org>

Let"s see what this database contains:

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```
We have to get rid of the commas. Can you find a function to get rid of the commas? 

```{r}
#gsub(",","", x)
```

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))
```

```{r}
x <- stats$Total
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
```

I am going to turn this into a function and then use `apply()` to work on the entire table of data.

```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x){
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
}

sumcomma(stats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma) / sumcomma(stats$Total)
```
```{r}
n.total <- sumcomma(stats$Total)
n.total
```

```{r}
sumcomma(stats$EM)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)
```
```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma) / sumcomma(stats$Total)
```
> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

X.ray = 85%
EM = 9%

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
(186898/248805733)*100
```

## visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

Mol* ("mol-star") viewer is now everywhere.The homepage is here: https://molstar.org/viewer/

I want to insert my image from Mol* here.

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

A Hydrogen molecule has a resolution that is too small, so it can't be seen.

## Working with bio3d 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1HSG")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can do a bioinformatics prediction of functional motions (i.e, flexibility/dynamics):

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
